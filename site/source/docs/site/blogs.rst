====================================
Blogs (ready-for-review) 
====================================

There are two main Emscripten blogs:

- `Developer blog (azakai) <http://mozakai.blogspot.com/>`_. 
-  `Mozilla blog <https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/tag/emscripten/>`_ (for sharing important "commercial" announcements and user stories).

In addition, other interesting blogs and demos are regularly shared on Twitter by the development team `(@kripken) <https://twitter.com/kripken>`_ and the broader community `(#emscripten) <https://twitter.com/hashtag/emscripten>`_. 


.. COMMENT BACKUP STUFF 
	Suggestion was to actually display RSS feeds from above links here. Perhaps including @kripen in feed. Not planning to do this at this time.
