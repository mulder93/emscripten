Optimizing Code (wiki-import)

.. note:: This article was migrated from the wiki (Fri, 25 Jul 2014 04:21) and is now the "master copy" (the version in the wiki will be deleted). It may not be a perfect rendering of the original but we hope to fix that soon!

Optimizing the Generated Code
=============================

By default Emscripten will compile code in a fairly safe way, and
without all the possible optimizations. You should generally try this
first, to make sure things work properly (if not, see the :ref:`Debugging`
page). Afterwards, you may want to compile your code so it runs faster.
This page explains how.

Note: You can also optimize the source code you are compiling into
JavaScript, see :ref:`Optimizing-the-source-code`.

Using emcc
==========

The recommended way to optimize code is with **emcc**. emcc works like
gcc, and basic usage is presented in the Emscripten :ref:`Tutorial`. As
mentioned there, you can use emcc to optimize, for example

::

      emcc -O2 file.cpp

To see what the different optimizations levels do, run

::

      emcc --help

-  The meaning of ``-O1, -O2`` etc. in emcc are not identical to
   gcc/clang/other compilers, even though they have been chosen to be as
   familiar. They can't be, because optimizing JavaScript is very
   different than optimizing native code. See the ``--help`` as
   mentioned before for details.
-  If you compile several files into a single JavaScript output, be sure
   to specify the same optimization flags during all invocations of emcc
   - both when compiling sources into objects, and objects into
   JavaScript or HTML. See :ref:`Building-Projects` for more details.
-  Aside from ``-Ox`` options, there are ``--llvm-lto`` options that you
   can read about in ``emcc --help``.

How to optimize code
====================

The following procedure is how you should normally optimize your code.
Note that all the flags here are for the link stage (when compiling
bitcode to JS), not to optimizing source files.

-  First, run emcc on your code without optimization. The default
   settings are set to be safe. Check that your code works (if not, see
   the :ref:`Debugging` page) before continuing.
-  Build with ``-O2`` to get an optimized build.
-  Build with ``-O0`` or ``-O1`` if you want faster iteration times, 0
   is the fastest to build but slowest to run, while 1 is in the middle.
-  If you want an even more optimized build than ``-O2``, see the rest
   of this page.

Advanced compiler settings
==========================

There are several flags you can pass to the compiler to affect code
generation, many of which can affect performance. Look in
``src/settings.js`` for which options are available and what they mean
(and if you want to look under the hood, see ``apply_opt_level`` in
``tools/shared.py`` for how -O1,2,3 affect them), as well as
``emcc --help``. A few useful ones are:

-  ``NO_EXIT_RUNTIME`` - When set, code can run but we never "shut down"
   the runtime environment, in the sense that no global destructors are
   run, no atexit calls are executed, etc. This is useful if your main()
   function finishes but you still want to execute code, and in fact
   necessary otherwise if you depend on a global structure it may have
   gone away - and for that reason, at runtime if we see that you call
   something like :c:func:`emscripten_set_main_loop` then we will never shut
   down the runtime. However, if you build with ``-s NO_EXIT_RUNTIME=1``
   then we know at **compile** time that you want that, which lets the
   compiler statically get rid of atexit calls and global destructors,
   which can improve code size and startup speed.

Very large projects
===================

Very large projects can hit some issues that smaller ones will never
see:

Memory initialization
---------------------

By default emscripten emits the static memory initialization inside the
js file, for simplicity. If it is very large, it can slow down startup,
or even cause issues in JS engines with limits on array sizes (you may
see ``Array initializer too large`` or ``Too much recursion`` for
example), and it also leads to very large js files. To avoid that,
emscripten can emit a binary file on the side by running emcc with

``--memory-init-file 1``

This is the default in ``-O2`` and above in emscripten 1.21.1 and above;
in earlier versions, you can enable it manually. When utilized, a file
with suffix ``.mem`` should appear, and it will be loaded by the JS. See
``emcc --help`` for more details.

Optimization levels
-------------------

You might want to build some source files in your project with ``-Os``
or ``-Oz`` to reduce code size, and the rest using ``-O2`` which gives
better performance (but increases code size). This allows you to keep
files you know are less performance-sensitive at a minimal size, while
keeping the files that need to be fast at maximal speed.

(Note that this only matters during the source to bitcode phase: during
bitcode to JS, ``-Os`` and ``-Oz`` are the same as ``-O2`` as there are
currently no JS specific optimization flags for ``-Os`` or ``-Oz``.)

Code size
---------

Tips for reducing code size include:

-  Memory init file as mentioned above.
-  Using -Os or -Oz, as also mentioned above.
-  Build bitcode to JS with -O3 which runs the expensive variable reuse
   pass (registerizeHarder)
-  Use llvm LTO during bitcode to JS
   ``-s INLINING_LIMIT=1 --llvm-lto 1`` (can break some code as the LTO
   code path is less tested)
-  That command also disables inlining. If sources were built with -Os
   or -Oz, it will avoid inlining anyhow for the most part, and you can
   try just ``--llvm-lto 1``
-  Use closure on the outside non-asm.js code ``--closure 1`` (can break
   some code)

Outlining
---------

``OUTLINING_LIMIT`` breaks up large functions into smaller ones, by
"outlining" code. This helps startup speed as well as runtime speed in
some cases, particularly when a codebase has huge functions, which
confuse JS engines. For more details see `this
blogpost <http://mozakai.blogspot.com/2013/08/outlining-workaround-for-jits-and-big.html>`__.

Aggressive Variable Elimination
-------------------------------

You can enable aggressive variable elimination with
``-s AGGRESSIVE_VARIABLE_ELIMINATION=1``. This will then attempt to
remove variables whenever possible, even at the cost of increasing code
size by duplicating expressions. This can improve speed in some cases
where you have extremely large functions, for example it can make sqlite
7% faster (which has a huge interpreter loop with thousands of lines in
it). However it can also he harmful in some cases, so test before using
it.

Other optimization issues
=========================

Exception Catching
------------------

In ``-O1`` and above exception catching is disabled. This prevents the
generation of try-catch blocks, which lets the code run much faster, and
also makes the code smaller. To re-enable them, run emcc with
``-s DISABLE_EXCEPTION_CATCHING=0``.

Viewing code optimization passes
--------------------------------

If you run emcc with ``EMCC_DEBUG=1`` (so, something like
``EMCC_DEBUG=1 emcc``), then it will output all the intermediate steps
after each optimization pass. The output will be in
``TEMP_DIR/emscripten_temp``, where ``TEMP_DIR`` is by default ``/tmp``
(and can be modified in ``~/.emscripten``). ``EMCC_DEBUG=2`` will output
even more information, a separate file will be saved for each JS
optimization pass.

Inlining
--------

Inlining often generates large functions. These allow the compiler's
optimizations to be more effective, but have downsides for JS engines:
They often do not try to optimize big functions for fear or long JIT
times, or they do JIT them and it causes noticeable pauses. So
ironically (or paradoxically) using -O1 or -O2, which inline by default,
can actually decrease performance in some cases.

You can try to avoid this issue by disabling inlining (in specific files
or everywhere), or by using the outliner feature, see `this blog
post <http://mozakai.blogspot.com/2013/08/outlining-workaround-for-jits-and-big.html>`__.

Unsafe optimizations
--------------------

A few **UNSAFE** optimizations you might want to try are:

-  ``-s FORCE_ALIGNED_MEMORY=1``: Makes all memory accesses fully
   aligned. This can break on code that actually requires unaligned
   accesses.
-  ``-s PRECISE_I64_MATH=1``: When disabled, does shortcuts when
   implementing 64-bit addition etc., using doubles instead of full
   emulation. This will break on code that uses the full range of 64-bit
   numbers.
-  ``--llvm-lto 1``: This enables LLVM's link-time opts, which can help
   in some cases but there are known issues with them as well, so use at
   your own risk. (There are btw a few modes aside from ``1``, see
   ``emcc --help``.)
-  ``--closure 1``: This can help with reducing the size of the
   non-generated (support/glue) code, and with startup. However it can
   break if you do not do proper closure compiler annotations and
   exports.

Profiling
=========

Modern browsers have JavaScript profilers, which can help find the
slower parts in your code. You should build your project with
``-profiling`` for this, that flag will leave the code in a
readable-enough state for profiling purposes (``-profiling`` should be
added in addition to your other optimization flags like ``-O1``, ``-O2``
or ``-O3``).

As each browser's profiler has limitations, it is highly recommended to
profile in multiple browsers in order to get the best information. Also,
in Firefox it is a good idea to profile both with and without asm.js
optimizations enabled (can remove the ``'use asm'`` string to disable).

Troubleshooting Slowness
========================

If you get worse performance than you expect - you should get about 1/2
the speed of a native build - then aside from the tips above, here is a
list of things to check:

-  Did you build with -O2 or -O3, **both** when compiling source code
   files **and** when generating JavaScript? The first is needed for
   LLVM optimizations, the latter for JS optimizations, all of which are
   crucial (see :ref:`Building-Projects`).
-  Is performance ok on one browser, but not in another? Testing on
   multiple browsers is always good to understand where a bug or
   performance issue lies. Please file a bug on the browser where things
   are slow.
-  In firefox, does the code validate? Look for "Successfully compiled
   asm.js code in the web console. If instead you see a validation
   error, make sure you are running an up-to-date version of firefox,
   and are building using an up-to-date version of emscripten. If the
   problem exists with those, please file a bug on emscripten.
