Getting started on Mac OS X (wiki-import)
=========================================
.. note:: This article was migrated from the wiki (Fri, 25 Jul 2014 04:21) and is now the "master copy" (the version in the wiki will be deleted). It may not be a perfect rendering of the original but we hope to fix that soon!

This guide instructs step-by-step on how to setup emscripten on a clean
Mac OS X box. The steps have been tested against OS X version 10.8.2.

Note for `homebrew <https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew>`__ users:
``brew install emscripten`` does all the steps below for you (including
installation of the llvm fastcomp compiler and patching the python
interpreter).

1. Install svn if you do not have it yet. It is distributed with XCode
   Command Line Tools in OSX App Store. See
   http://superuser.com/questions/455214/where-is-svn-on-os-x-mountain-lion

-  Install XCode from OSX App Store.
-  In XCode->Preferences->Downloads, install Command Line Tools.
-  Test that svn works from command line: type 'svn --version' in
   terminal.

2. Install git if you do not have it yet:

-  Allow installation of unsigned packages, or installing git package
   won't succeed:
   https://www.my-private-network.co.uk/knowledge-base/apple-related-questions/osx-unsigned-apps.html
-  Download and install git from http://git-scm.com/
-  Test that git works from command line: type 'git --version' in
   terminal.

3. Install cmake if you do not have it yet:

-  Download and install cmake-2.8.10.2-Darwin64-universal.dmg or newer
   from http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
-  Test that cmake works from command line: type 'cmake --version' in
   terminal.

4. Build LLVM+Clang 3.2 from SVN repository:

-  cd ~
-  svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/tags/RELEASE\_32/final
   llvm32
-  cd llvm32/tools
-  svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/tags/RELEASE\_32/final
   clang
-  cd ../..
-  mkdir llvm32build
-  cd llvm32build
-  cmake -DCMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Release -G "Unix Makefiles" ../llvm32
-  make

After these steps, Clang 3.2 will be built into ~/llvm32build/bin. The
source tree ~/llvm32 is not needed anymore, if you want to conserve disk
space.

Note that XCode ships with a custom version of Clang (3.1svn or 3.2svn
depending on XCode version). It may be possible to omit this step and
just use the version provided by XCode, but the LLVM 3.2 RELEASE version
is preferred, since that is the "officially supported version" the
emscripten OSX unit tests are run against.

5. Set up Clang 3.2 in PATH:

-  cd ~
-  echo "export PATH=~/llvm32build/bin:$PATH" >> .profile

The above change is permanent and it persists between system restarts.
It only affects the current user.

6. Close all terminal windows, and open a new one. Check that clang
   works ok in path:

-  cd ~
-  clang --version

The command should output: clang version 3.2 (tags/RELEASE\_32/final
176107) Target: x86\_64-apple-darwin12.2.1 Thread model: posix

7. Delete old .emscripten file if it happened to exist:

-  rm ~/.emscripten
-  rm -rf ~/.emscripten\_cache

8. Set up node:

-  Download and install node from http://nodejs.org/
-  Test that node works from command line: type 'node --version' in
   terminal.

9. Obtain emscripten:

-  cd ~
-  git clone https://github.com/kripken/emscripten.git

By default, git will clone the emscripten 'incoming' branch, which is
the branch where the newest developments of emscripten occur. If you
want to use a more stable branch, switch to the 'master' branch: - cd
~/emscripten - git checkout master

10. Setup 'python2': (this step is needed to workaround a bug reported
    in `#763 <https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/issues/763>`__)

-  In terminal, type 'python2 --version'. If you get a "command not
   found", type the following:
-  cd /usr/bin
-  sudo ln python python2
-  sudo ln
   ../../System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python2.7
   python22.7
-  Issue 'python2 --version' again. It should now print Python 2.7.2

11. Perform emscripten "first run":

-  cd ~/emscripten
-  ./emcc --help
-  edit the file ~/.emscripten in a text editor to set up any required
   paths.

12. (Optional) Compile a simple test program to check that everything
    works:

-  cd ~/emscripten
-  ./em++ tests/hello\_world.cpp
-  node a.out.js

The first run will most likely pop up an automatic prompt that asks to
install java. Proceed, and after installation finishes, rerun the above
commands. Running node should output: hello, world!

13. (Optional) Compile a simple WebGL program to check that .html output
    and GLES2/WebGL works:

-  cd ~/emscripten
-  ./emcc tests/hello\_world\_gles.c -o hello\_world\_gles.html
-  open hello\_world\_gles.html

If the Safari 6 browser pops up with a message "Could not create canvas
:(", follow these instructions to enable WebGL support in Safari:

14. (Optional) Run the full battery of tests to check that emscripten is
    perfectly operational on the current platform:

-  cd ~/emscripten
-  python tests/runner.py
-  python tests/runner.py benchmark

Note that some tests will likely fail. Cross-reference the results with
https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/issues?labels=tests to see if you
are receiving currently unknown issues.
