This page describes how to use Emscripten on Windows.

Setting up the Emscripten Toolchain on Windows
----------------------------------------------

This section contains basic instructions on how to start using
Emscripten on a clean Windows box. After these steps, you can invoke
emcc from the command line by calling 'python emcc'. 64-bit versions of
all needed dependencies are preferred, and may be required if you are
building large projects.

Installing required tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Install Python 2.x (not 3.x) from http://www.python.org/.

-  e.g.
   `python-2.7.5.amd64.msi <http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.5/python-2.7.5.amd64.msi>`__
   for a 64-bit install.
-  If you plan to use the Visual Studio integration, do NOT install the
   64-bit version. Get the 32-bit version of python from
   `python-2.7.5.msi <http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.5/python-2.7.5.msi>`__.
-  Add the Python bin directory to your PATH. (Open up System Settings,
   Advanced system properties, click Environment Variables. Add "C:27"
   to the PATH, separated by a semicolon.) If on the other hand
   ``python.exe`` appears in "C:27" and not under bin, just add "C:27".

2. Install node.js from http://nodejs.org/

-  e.g.
   `node-v0.10.17-x64.msi <http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.17/x64/node-v0.10.17-x64.msi>`__
-  If you plan to use the Visual Studio integration, do NOT install the
   64-bit version. Get the 32-bit version of node.js from
   `node-v0.10.17-x86.msi <http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.17/node-v0.10.17-x86.msi>`__.

3. Setup gcc 4.6 and llvm-clang 3.2.

-  If you like building the tools yourself or plan to use the Visual
   Studio integration (for which you need 32-bit versions of the tools)
   see below for how to build LLVM/Clang from source.
-  Otherwise download the following 64-bit builds
-  

   -  

      -  `x86\_64-w64-mingw32-gcc-4.6.3-2-release-win64\_rubenvb.7z <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/rubenvb/gcc-4.6-release/x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc-4.6.3-2-release-win64_rubenvb.7z/download>`__

-  

   -  

      -  `x86\_64-w64-mingw32-clang-3.2-release-win64\_rubenvb.7z <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/rubenvb/clang-3.2-release/x86_64-w64-mingw32-clang-3.2-release-win64_rubenvb.7z/download>`__

-  Extract both of them using `7zip <http://7-zip.org>`__ to the same
   location, e.g. C:64

4. If you do not already have a git client, Install `Github for
   Windows <http://windows.github.com/>`__.
5. Clone the ``kripken/emscripten`` repository from github. The
   emscripten repository contains the main compiler tool for compiling
   C/C++ programs to JavaScript.

-  Launch the GitHub for Windows Client. You may click "Skip Setup" if
   you don't have a github account.
-  (optional) Select "Options" from the gear menu, and customize the
   default storage directory. A path without spaces can save you lots of
   pain down the line.
-  In your web browser, open https://github.com/kripken/emscripten and
   press the "Clone in Windows" button.
-  Note: if you already had a different git client, the repository URL
   is ``https://github.com/kripken/emscripten.git`` (e.g.
   ``git clone https://github.com/kripken/emscripten.git``)

Configuring Emscripten
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Open up a command prompt, and change to the directory where you
   cloned the emscripten repository. By default with the GitHub client,
   this will be ``C:\Users\username\Documents\GitHub\emscripten``.
2. Run ``python emcc --help``

-  You should get a ``Welcome to Emscripten!`` message. Behind the
   scenes, emscripten generated a file called ``.emscripten`` in your
   Windows home folder.
-  If you do not see this message, make sure that python is properly in
   your global PATH, and that you are in the emscripten directory.

3. Edit ``C:\Users\username\.emscripten``:

   1. Edit the variable ``EMSCRIPTEN_ROOT`` to point to the emscripten
      root folder, e.g.
      ``EMSCRIPTEN_ROOT = 'C:/Users/username/Documents/GitHub/emscripten'``
      (Note: use forward slashes)
   2. Edit the variable ``LLVM_ROOT`` to point directly to the path
      where you installed clang.exe, e.g.
      ``LLVM_ROOT = 'C:/mingw64/bin'``
   3. Edit the variable TEMP\_DIR to point to a valid Windows path on
      your local system, e.g. ``TEMP_DIR = 'C:/tmp'``, and create that
      folder on the local filesystem if it doesn't exist.
   4. If you are planning on using Cygwin and cygwin make in the future,
      copy the .emscripten file to your cygwin home folder as well, e.g.
      copy C:.emscripten C: (There is a bug in emscripten that it
      currently looks for the file .emscripten in two places (Win7 user
      home folder or cygwin user home folder), depending on the
      environment it is executed in, so as a current workaround these
      files must be present and identical on Windows. (see `issue
      #411 <https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/issues/411>`__))

Integrating Emscripten to Visual Studio 2010
--------------------------------------------

It is possible to integrate the Emscripten compiler directly to Visual
Studio. This allows existing VS .sln files to be directly built using
emcc. The Microsoft compiler property pages are replaced by Clang and
emcc -specific options.

1. Install Visual Studio 2010

-  Note: Express version has not been tested, but should be ok. Please
   drop a line on emscripten IRC channel or mailing list to report your
   experience with VS2010 Express!

2. Clone the juj/vs-tool repository from github:

-  git clone https://github.com/juj/vs-tool
-  The vs-tool repository contains a plugin to Visual Studio 2010 (or
   rather, to MSBuild) that instructs Visual Studio how to use the
   llvm-clang and emscripten toolchain.

3.  Install vs-tool itself.
4.  Navigate to folder vs-tool
5.  Copy the folders Clang and Emscripten to C:Files (x86).Cpp.0\\.
6.  Set up the required environment variables for vs-tool.
7.  Windows 7: Open Control Panel -- System -- Advanced System Settings
    -- Environment Variables.
8.  Create a new environment variable 'CLANG\_BIN' and set it to point
    to the folder where you built clang to (path to clang.exe) E.g.

    -  SETX CLANG\_BIN C:-build
    -  This is how vs-tool locates the folder to your llvm-clang
       compiler. Alternatively, this path can be set per-project in
       Visual Studio project property pages.

9.  Create a new environment variable 'EMSCRIPTEN' and set it to point
    to the emscripten git repository root folder (the path where you
    copied emcc.exe and other exes to). E.g.

    -  SETX EMSCRIPTEN C:
    -  This is how vs-tool locates the emscripten compiler. This path
       can also be overridden per-project in VS property pages.

10. Create a new environment variable 'EMCC\_WEBBROWSER\_EXE' and set it
    to point to an executable you want to use to browse
    emscripten-generated web pages from Visual Studio. This process is
    spawned when you tap Start (Ctrl-F5) in Visual Studio for a
    emscripten-targeted project.

    -  SETX EMCC\_WEBBROWSER\_EXE C:Files (x86)Firefox.exe

11. Now you are all set to start developing Emscripten-based projects
    from Visual Studio. To test the installation, open the Visual Studio
    solution file 10\_msvc10.sln.

Tips for using Emscripten from the Visual Studio 2010 IDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build a Visual Studio solution using the Emscripten toolchain, select
the "Emscripten" configuration from the Configuration Manager dropdown
as the active configuration, and choose Build Solution (F7).

To launch a project directly to a web browser from Visual Studio,
right-click on the project to run, choose "Set as Startup Project", and
select Start without Debugging (Ctrl+F5). This should launch the
generated .html file to the browser you specified in
EMCC\_WEBBROWSER\_EXE. A bug(?) in Visual Studio causes a "Executable
for Debug Session" dialog to occasionally open up when you hit Ctrl+F5.
This can be ignored by clicking Yes, then No, or simply by hitting Esc
and then tapping Ctrl+F5 again.

llvm-clang and emscripten compiler settings can be edited for the
project in the "usual" Visual Studio fashion: First make sure that the
Emscripten platform configuration is active, then right-click on a
project, and choose Properties. In the Project properties dialog, two
tree nodes Clang C/C++ and Emcc Linker should exist, which allow you to
specify the desired compilation options.

If you have an existing solution file you want to build using
Emscripten, open the Configuration Manager.. dialog for the solution,
and in the Active Solution Platform dropdown, choose New.... In the new
dialog, choose Emscripten as the platform name, and Copy settings from
Empty. After this, you can switch between building the solution for
Win32 and Emscripten from the Configuration Manager dropdown list.

When you want to create a new Visual Studio project for Emscripten, we
recommend you start with a Visual C++ Empty Project. This will create a
new project for the Win32 platform. Then convert that project for
Emscripten as outlined in the previous paragraph.

Building LLVM/Clang from Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case the above-referenced prebuilt binaries do not work for you, you
can build LLVM and Clang from source.

To install and set up ``llvm-clang 3.2``, open a Visual Studio 2010
command prompt and type:

1. ``svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/tags/RELEASE_32/final llvm``
2. ``cd llvm\tools``
3. ``svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/tags/RELEASE_32/final clang``
4. ``cd ..\\..``
5. ``mkdir build``
6. ``cd build``
7. ``cmake -G "Visual Studio 10" ..\llvm``
8. ``msbuild LLVM.sln /p:Configuration=Release``

If you have problems with the above, see more help here:
http://clang.llvm.org/get\_started.html

**NOTE**: Instead of checking out the trunk as the guide suggests, check
out the latest tagged release of Clang (3.2 at the time of writing). An
older version will not most likely work with Emscripten.
