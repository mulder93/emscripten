 *
 * Pausing and resuming the main loop is useful if your app

 * Registers callback functions for receiving socket events.
 * These events are analogous to WebSocket events but are emitted
 * *after* the internal emscripten socket processing has occurred
 * so, for example, the message callback will be triggered after
 * the data has been added to the recv_queue. This means that an
 * application receiving this callback can simply read/recv the data
 * using the file descriptor passed as a parameter to the callback.
 * All of the callbacks are passed a file descriptor representing
 * the fd that the notified activity took place on. The error
 * callback also takes an int representing errno and a char* that
 * represents the error message.
 *
 * Only a single callback function may be registered to handle any
 * given Event, so calling a given registration function more than
 * once will cause the first callback to be replaced by the second.
 * Similarly passing a NULL callback function to any
 * emscripten_set_socket_*_callback call will deregister the callback
 * registered for that Event.
 *
 * The userData pointer allows arbitrary data specified during Event
 * registration to be passed to the callback, this is particularly
 * useful for passing "this" pointers around in Object Oriented code.
 *
 * In addition to being able to register network callbacks from C
 * it is also possible for native JavaScript code to directly use the
 * underlying mechanism used to implement the callback registration.
 * For example, the following are the simple logging callbacks that
 * are registered by default when SOCKET_DEBUG is enabled
 * Module['websocket']['on']('error', function(error) {console.log('Socket error ' + error);});
 * Module['websocket']['on']('open', function(fd) {console.log('Socket open fd = ' + fd);});
 * Module['websocket']['on']('listen', function(fd) {console.log('Socket listen fd = ' + fd);});
 * Module['websocket']['on']('connection', function(fd) {console.log('Socket connection fd = ' + fd);});
 * Module['websocket']['on']('message', function(fd) {console.log('Socket message fd = ' + fd);});
 * Module['websocket']['on']('close', function(fd) {console.log('Socket close fd = ' + fd);});
 *
 * Most of the JavaScript callback functions above get passed the
 * file descriptor of the socket that triggered the callback, the
 * on error callback however gets passed an *array* that contains
 * the file descriptor, the error code and an error message.
 *
 * Note that the underlying JavaScript implementation doesn't pass
 * userData, this is actually mostly of use to C/C++ code and the
 * emscripten_set_socket_*_callback calls actually create a closure
 * containing the userData and pass that as the callback to the
 * underlying JavaScript Event registration mechanism.
